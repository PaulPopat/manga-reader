# Manga Reader

This is a simple tool for publishing personal Manga and Comic projects.
Simply run the compose and go to port 1337 to access the CMS.
If you expose the `/app/manga-reader-frontend/_` volume then you can place static images and then you can also expose `/app/manga-reader-cms/tmp`
to store the database someplace on the local disk.
